What I learned from this course:
I came to know about interesting ways to present geographical data using various open source tools. My prior knowledge about best practices for visualizations were confirmed, escpecially with regards to designing the right charts in the right way, the need for compelling data story and the importance of textual descriptions to emphasize, substantiate or extend the overall story. As my next steps, I would like to explore the various tools used in this course to further my knowledge.
